# City 3d Model
 
 
The Progress City model was once a spectacular site. Housed on the second level of the Carousel Theater at Disneyland above The Carousel of Progress, it was often visited but not-so-often photographed or filmed. It was a large model with many moving parts and electric lights.
 
Let's give give credit where credit's due. Though the model is in a very dilapidated state after all these years, it's presented in a way that makes it look pretty good. I'd love to see moving parts and fewer broken pieces, but from a moving WEDWay car, in a dark tunnel, behing glass, the thing doesn't look half bad.

Photos by Fritz, Mitch and Hoot. A special thanks to Hoot who has done a heap of research and investigation involving the model. He was the one who showed me door to get to the model and the catwalk above. Photos were taken on assignment and with permission. Please don't attempt to access the model.
 
very nice, considering how much you looked around and how little you could find. i love things like this. I had no idea the model had been that large! it's amazing! it's one of the reasons i love disney so much are the amazing details, especially in the models and actual works.
 
btw, I don't know when the last time you came by to look at the model, but alot of the lights and moving parts work again. I know the double ferris wheel (and something else I can't recall) mover very well, but i would love to have seen the trains and people movers move. that's a shame.

I'm starting to realize how much wasn't made of the worlds fair, video or photo. it's a shame! I've been looking up some world's fair videos on youtube. I posted some that have brief glimpses of the GE pavallion. I'd look up the GM FUTURAMA one; it's so much like a disney one, without having been one.
 
You'd think that Dave Smith and the Disney Archives folks would be interested in this being restored to its original version, not just Imagineering. We all know that "Disney(land||World) is not a museum", but there is an audience and interest in seeing these types of displays and history of where the company as a whole - and the parks in particular - came from.
 
While a permanent exhibit in Epcot on park history would appease those fanboys who would salivate over these types of things - and goodness knows there's room for it there - creating such a museum or exhibit in an external facility would probably be a better idea. The WDFM seems like a logical choice, but I don't think they have the room for something like this.
 
All that said, there needs to be a balance between "moving forward" and "preserving history". Some things aren't meant to be (or should be) kept in their original state. Converting America Rocks characters for Splash Mountain, for example, works. The original Progress City model, on the other hand, does fit into a larger picture and should have an advocate for its restoration...even if the restoration is just of the piece seen on the TTA.

I don't know. I think there's already a perfect place for the restored model at WDW -- One Man's Dream at DHS. EPCOT literally was one man's dream, and was at the very center (no pun intended) of Walt's dream for the Florida Project.
 
Thank you for this great post and wonderful pictures. Did I see this model first at the New York World's Fair perhaps? I think so. In any case, ever notice the similarity between this original model and the Burj Dubai? Of course the scale is different, but the central tower, the surrounding lake, the radiating transportation systems, and the smaller buildings around it--they are all there in the Disney model.  
Take a look:

It amazes me that the company scrapped EPCOT saying it just wouldn't work. Ever drive down I-4 just south of Disney? There's a resort community (can't recall the name) with a central tower, business, retail, and restaurant space. Housing and recreation around the city center...... sounds familiar and it's working today on a grand scale. If you're driving East at night, the central tower (from the side) looks just like EPCOT! Maybe Walt was ahead of his time and MAYBE his staff should have listened.
 
Well, speaking of epcot and museums, they did have that brief one for the 25th anniversary in one of their small halls in innoventions; had artifacts and many goodies from past attractions, etc from the park's history. I think it would be perfect to have had it there. I still wish they'd bring back the other museum. it's still there, always closed, being used as a segway training room, so much still in there. i always take a look under the door and wish...
 
So, it's something I've wondered while reading up on it; were you in WDI then? or at least some facet of disney that controls things?  
Either way, i salute you and fritz for the fight; it's one I'm openly sad has lost. I lament it, and hope for the better in the long run :) I really hope to join in in my coming years, time will tell.
 
and i've heard of champions gate, i just never realized thats what it was meant to be. and of course it would work, hoot, think of the man who imagined it ;) but yes, I'm sure in would be very successful with the right workings and planning. :)
 
I fell in love with this model city at the World's Fair in 1965. My own model "Magic Kingdom" in my basement has it's roots in Progress City. I'd love to see the entire model restored. It was iconic.

Man oh man oh man, am I impressed! This is the best collection of Progress City photos I've ever seen. I've been fascinated by the thing for decades, but there's really very little to be found online about it, and what there is lacks detail. This is amazing. Please do post more!
 
I would very much love to see this restored to it's former glory. As a child I only got to see this once and was amazed at seeing Progress City and it's workings. Oh how I would have loved to had such a city like this as a child to play in with my matchbox and hot wheel cars. I really hope there could be someway that a petition could be made or something to encourage Disney to bring this back for display. As much as I understand that the times and technology have changed, I long for the days of how Tomorrowland use to be and look.
 
This post has taken my breath away. I've been obsessed with this model for years, and I would love to hear more about it's history in both parks. Is there anything further that could be done to see this model restored to it's former glory? Surely the Disney Archives must have the original plans somewhere that could be followed?
 
I've contacted Jim Korkis by email to see if he has any 'untold' stories about the model that would be of some use, we need to make this happen! One of the reasons that I love the model is that was commissioned (but never seen) by Walt at the time he was thinking about EPCOT. There's so much crossover of ideas between the World Fair, EPCOT, Carrousel of Progress, Tommorrowland, it's a shame that none of them were fully realised. I would love to see this model properly document and restored.
 
"Restoration" would be super-cool and shiny and all, but probably kind of impractical for the same reasons they tore up the original model in the first place. In lieu of that, what I'd really love to see (Actually, what I'd really like to personally have) is a CGI model of the original model that I could zoom through, look at stuff, examine from a zillion different locations, etc.
 
I stumbled across this page while trying to describe to my wife the coolest thing I had ever seen as a child at Disneyland. It was very nearly my favorite part of the trip.. And I had absolutely no problem sitting through the somewhat boring show in order to get to gaze at this gem. I certainly hope it gets fully restored one day.
 
I just read this article. I know if I had the time I would totally voluteer my time and talent to help restore something so important to the Disney name and company... So when you have had enough I have a great fishing spot just below Yellowstone. It is magical and all your cares just float down the river... Consider yourself invited!
 
If you want to know how to get there, it's pretty easy if you have a key or happen to find an unlocked door. Just go into Cosmic Ray's and next to the restrooms there is a door, open the door and there is a stairway, go up the stairway and it leads to an air handler room and then on the left hand side there is another door, open the door then climb under the beams and then you are underneath the model.
 
Just came across you on Facebook; and this was one of the first articles I stumbled across. Wow! Our family did a SoCal vacation in June 1971, I had just graduated from high school. The Progress City model would become my life's obsession and inspiration for my career as a landscape designer and city planner. I kept a color photocopy of the original watercolor rendering above my desk all through college, graduate school and work. I keep a second copy here at the home office. I recently visited the WDFM in San Francisco. Not surprizingly the Ultimate Disneyland model was the highlight of the trip and brought back all the memories of my 1971 Disneyland visit. It would be wonderful to restore/recreate the model and place it where everyone could see it. Possiblly Imigination at Epcot...
 
I visited Disneyland several times in the early 70s and I loved the Carousel of Progress and this model. It was awesome. I hope that someday the entire artifact can be restored and displayed with the dignity it deserves.
